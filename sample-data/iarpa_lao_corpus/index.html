<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2017S08</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>IARPA Babel Lao Language Pack IARPA-babel203b-v3.1a, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2017S08 and ISBN 1-58563-794-7, was developed by <a href="http://www.appen.com/">Appen</a> for the  
  IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) <a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel">Babel</a> program.
   It contains approximately 207 hours of Lao 
   conversational and scripted
telephone speech collected in 2013 along with corresponding transcripts.</p>
<p>The Babel program focuses on underserved languages and seeks to develop speech recognition technology that can be rapidly applied to any human language to support keyword search performance over large amounts of recorded speech.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The Lao
  speech in this release represents that spoken in the Vientiane dialect region in Laos. The gender distribution among speakers is approximately equal; speakers' ages range from 16 years to 60 years. Calls were made using different telephones (e.g., mobile, landline) from a variety of environments including the street, a home or office, a public place, and inside a vehicle.</p>
<p>Audio data is presented as 8kHz 8-bit a-law encoded audio in sphere format and 48kHz 24-bit PCM encoded audio in wav format. Transcripts are encoded in UTF-8. The romanization scheme was developed by Appen and  was based on the scheme developed by the American Library Association and Library of Congress. Further information about transcription methodology is contained in the documentation accompanying this release.</p>
<p>Evaluation data is available from <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> in support of 
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openkws.cfm">OpenKWS</a>.</p>
