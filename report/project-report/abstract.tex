% The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is one of the capital's most remarkable monuments.
% %
% As the main symbol of Rome, it is an imposing construction with almost 2,000 years of history.
% %
% The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus.
% %
% After completion, the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheatre, measuring 188 meters in length, 156 meters in width and 57 meters in height.

% %
% During the Roman Empire time, the Roman Colosseum allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles.
% %
% The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles and gladiator fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.
% %
% Such events were occasionally on a huge scale.
% %
% Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days.
% %
% During lunch intervals, executions \textit{ad bestias} would be staged.
% %
% Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces.
% %
% Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.
% %
% The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated in the 6th century.
