	abstract = {This paper introduces a new corpus of read English speech, suitable for training and evaluating speech recognition systems. The LibriSpeech corpus is derived from audiobooks that are part of the LibriVox project, and contains 1000 hours of speech sampled at 16 kHz. We have made the corpus freely available for download, along with separately prepared language-model training data and pre-built language models. We show that acoustic models trained on LibriSpeech give lower error rate on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) test sets than models trained on WSJ itself. We are also releasing Kaldi scripts that make it easy to build these systems.},

	abstract = {This work introduces open-source software for unified corpus analysis: integrating speech corpora and querying across them, and describes the software, two case studies using it to examine effects on pitch and duration across languages, and outline planned future development. Speech datasets from many languages, styles, and sources exist in the world, representing significant potential for scientific studies of speech—particularly given structural similarities among all speech datasets. However, studies using multiple speech corpora remain difficult in practice, due to corpus size, complexity, and differing formats. We introduce open-source software for unified corpus analysis: integrating speech corpora and querying across them. Corpora are stored in a custom ‘polyglot persistence’ scheme that combines three sub-databases mirroring different data types: a Neo4j graph database to represent temporal annotation graph structure, and SQL and InfluxDB databases to represent metaand acoustic data. This scheme abstracts away from the idiosyncratic formats of different speech corpora, while mirroring the structure of different data types improves speed and scalability. A Python API and a GUI both allow for: enriching the database with positional, hierarchical, temporal, and signal measures (e.g. utterance boundaries, f0) that are useful for linguistic analysis; querying the database using a simple query language; and exporting query results to standard formats for further analysis. We describe the software, summarize two case studies using it to examine effects on pitch and duration across languages, and outline planned future development.},

	abstract = {The cot–caught merger or LOT–THOUGHT merger, formally known in linguistics as the low back merger, is a sound change present in some dialects of English where speakers do not distinguish the vowel phonemes in "cot" and "caught". "Cot" and "caught" (along with "bot" and "bought", "pond" and "pawned", etc.) is an example of a minimal pair that is lost as a result of this sound change. The phonemes involved in the cot–caught merger, the low back vowels, are typically represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet as /ɒ/ and /ɔ/, respectively (in the U.S., co-occurring with the father–bother merger, as /ɑ/ and /ɔ/). The merger is typical of most Canadian and Scottish English dialects as well as many Irish and U.S. English dialects.
An additional vowel merger, the father–bother merger, which spread through North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, has resulted today in a three-way merger in which most Canadian and many U.S. accents have no vowel difference in words like "palm" /ɑ/, "lot" /ɒ/, and "thought" /ɔ/.},
