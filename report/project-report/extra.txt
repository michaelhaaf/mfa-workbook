Several other systems for management and analysis of speech corpora exist (e.g. [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]), including three systems which are most similar to Polyglot-SCT. Phon [15] is a system for creating and querying corpora. Phon uses a relational database to store data, but does not adopt the annotation graph formalism. Phon is integrated with Praat [20], and allows for a range of acoustic analyses and linguistic analyses (e.g. syllabification) across many languages. LaBB-CAT [16] stores recordings and associated transcriptions as annotation graphs in a relational database. In addition to import, export, and querying, LaBB-CAT can enrich a corpus in various ways (e.g. forced alignment, syllabification), and offers integration with Praat and lexical databases. EMU-SDMS [17] is a system consisting of an R [21] package, to simplify the full pipeline of corpus research to a single environment for data preparation and analysis, and a web application for annotation and file inspection. EMU also uses annotation graphs, which are stored in JSON files, as are subsequent measurements (f0, etc.) made using a signal processing library. Querying is done through a custom query language. Polyglot-SCT differs from other systems in its goals: it is optimized for large-scale studies across many corpora, maximizing scalability, speed, and ease of use. \change{don't plagiarise this section; tweek for relevancy/actually do a review}


    - [X] tones removable (remove accent and stress)
    - [ ] tones (highly lang specific, lithu below):
        - [ ] short vowels: single character
        - [ ] long vowels: any other nucleus
        - [ ] stressed syllables: begin with "
        - [ ] rising accent: contains "_R"
        - [ ] falling accent: contains "_F"
        - [ ] 1) short vowel, unstressed
        - [ ] 2) short vowel, stressed
        - [ ] 3) long vowel, unstressed
        - [ ] 4) long vowel, rising accent
        - [ ] 5) long vowel, falling accent

              Now, for "tone".  My description above was incomplete / wrong.  In reality:
              Lithuanian syllables can be "short" or "long".  Short = (I think!) nucleus is just a, E, I, O, U,
              Long = any other nucleus: that includes ones like a r, i e, u o, o: ...
              Short syllables can be "stressed" or "unstressed", but cannot bear "accent"
              Long syllables can be stressed with "rising" accent, stressed with "falling" accent, or unstressed.


        Here are some things to be aware of:
        For parsing purposes we can think of Lithuanian as having four "tones" (which are actually combinations of stress and pitch accent):
        1: syllable begins with ", does not end with :_R or :_F
        2: syllable begins with ", ends with :_R
        3: syllable begins with ", ends with :_F
        4: all other syllables
        There should be no syllables that end with :R or :_F but don't begin with " (get in touch if so)
        You can use the notation above to make versions of the MFA lexicon with and without "tone", e.g.:
        lexicon entry " n' E  -> n' E1
        lexicon entry " A:_R . I r' . v' e: -> A:2 I r' v' e:
        Some lines of the dictionary have multiple pronunciations (like "Afganistane"), which should be multiple lines in the MFA lexicon (one for each pronunciation)
        word boundary. You can remove these. 
        % Ex: entry A_R_V_I is " a # " E r_R # " v' e:_R # " I, which would become a1 E2 v' e:2 I1

        So, once you determine the nucleus of a syllable, you can determine the onset and coda.  The nucleus is:
        any vowel
        a sequence of two vowels
        (or) a sequence of one vowel + a sonorant: the phones r, l, m, n (p. 6 of PDF)
        Some examples:
        a . d o: . " m a_F I . t' I s : nuclei are a, o, a I , I
        a n' . " d' r' o:_F . n' I . S' k' I s : nuclei are a, o:, I, I


        So there are actually five cases, which we can call "tone" for comparability with Cantonese:
        1. short vowel, unstressed
        2. short vowel, stressed
        3. long vowel, unstressed
        4. long vowel, rising accent
        5. long vowel, falling accent
        Stressed syllables are those which begin with ", rising accent syllables contain _R and falling accent syllables contain _F.  (_R and _F don't need to be at the end of the syllable -- I was wrong above.)
