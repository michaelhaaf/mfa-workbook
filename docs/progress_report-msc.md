7.  **Summary of Research Progress (Note: Items 7 and 8 together should not exceed one page):**
    - Research Assistantship onboarding:
        - account created and development software set up on Compute Canada, Roquefort, and Mimi servers. 
        - diagnostic alignment tasks (English and Cantonese corpuses) complete. 
        - transcript to testgrid processing script implemented.
        - syllable datatype with constructor for list of phonemes unit/function tested and implemeted.
        - serializer/deserializer pattern unit/function tested and implemented to generalize data processing across languages and data sources.
    - Capstone project onboarding: 
        - development software (MFA and polyglotDB) installed and run. 
        - initial research into package development (conda, architecture, dependencies) complete.

\bigskip

8.  **Research Plan for the Next 4 Months:**
    - Research Assistantship tasks:
        - work with Connie to implement robust raw corpus -> MFA alignment pipeline generalized across languages.
        - codebase refactoring tasks (implement generalizable patterns, unit testing) 
    - Capstone project tasks:
        - Short term goals (defined and completed on a monthly basis):  
            - conduct existing polyglotDB tutorials, raise/log issues throughout
            - publish polyglotDB usage tutorials (5-10 over the course of 4 months) demonstrating variety of useful applications for public non-expert consumption
            - publish polyglotDB installation tutorials, investigate common issues experienced by non-expert users
        - Long term goals (complete by May 1 2022):
            - repackage polyglotDB for automated install to work across common architectures (proposal: create condaforge package for polyglotDB)
            - all functionality referred to in existing polyglotDB documentation should have correponding tutorials
        - Strech goals (if all other goals are complete):
            - implement known "breakfast experiments": demonstrate polyglotDB utility in novel "quick" research problems
            - create new "breakfast experiements": conduct novel research using polyglotDB
