# MFA installation/alignment workbook notes

## General
- see discussion-qs.txt for written answers to task questions.
- scripts/data folders should be discoverable, let me know if anything is hard to find.

## Installation Notes
- Installation went smoothly on Ubuntu 20.04 clean virtual machine
- Note: conda's openblas package did not work. I installed openblas from Debian repo instead (sudo apt install libopenblas-dev)
